I worked on both the front-end and back-end of a data handling application. The application handles the data sent by venders and store that data into company's database for further analysis. I worked  on the front-end to make it look pleasant and easy to use. I worked on the backend to make the data handling more smooth, so that future operations that are to be performed on the data can be performed smoothly and easily."
